Spawning
To spawn naturally, a ghast requires a solid block below it and a free space 5×5 blocks wide and 4 blocks high. They spawn only in the basalt deltas, nether wastes, and soul sand valley biomes, all three of which exist only in the Nether dimension, and in any light level. In Java Edition ghasts cannot spawn in soul sand valleys if another ghast is within 16 blocks of spherical distance to the intended spawning location; In Bedrock Edition, two ghasts can spawn within any 4 chunk span.

Ghasts do not spawn in nether fortresses, but they can wander nearby.

Drops
Ghast tear (0–1) . Looting increases the maximum ghast tears dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 4 ghast tears with Looting III.
Gunpowder (0–2) . Looting increases the maximum gunpowder dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 5 gunpowder with Looting III.
5 when killed by the player.
Behavior
Ghasts float around the Nether with their eyes and mouth closed and periodically make crying sounds, which can be heard from up to 80 blocks away. They have a hitbox of 4×4×4 blocks, as well as nine tentacles that are not included in the hitbox.

When within range, a ghast faces the player and shoots a fireball every 3 seconds, opening its eyes and mouth and making a screeching sound. A ghast requires a line of sight to the player before firing, which can be blocked by any solid block including transparent blocks. In Java Edition, they target players within 64 blocks horizontally and 4 blocks vertically[1], and continue attacking as long as they are within a 64 block sphere and have line of sight. In Bedrock Edition, a ghast normally targets a player within a sphere of 28 blocks, increasing to 64 blocks if the player damages it.

Ghasts can cause other mobs to attack them, but in Java Edition they never target other mobs, only the player.

Unlike most other hostile mobs, ghasts do not attempt to approach the player once aggravated, but instead fire at the player from their position within firing range.

When at close range, ghasts may take damage and die from their own fireball explosions.

Ghasts can be set on fire, but fire or lava does not harm them. When a ghast sinks into lava, or crosses a lava fall, its speed drops and it is immobilized for a while, making it more vulnerable to arrow shots.

Despite their ghostly appearance, ghasts are not considered undead mobs.[2] This means they can drown,[3] are damaged by Instant Damage[4] and healed by Instant Health, are affected by Poison,[5] and are not affected by Smite.[6]

Although they are not undead mobs, ghasts are never targeted by withers deliberately.[7]

Despite that they are flying mobs, ghasts can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.[8]
